Have you ever became angry due to the path handling in MATLAB. If you do, this project could be interesting for you. 

__MATLAB Library System__ is a library handling module that makes shipment and adding/removing MATLAB scripts and functions convenient for you and your customers.


# Using the system

## Manual way

1. Create a new folder that will be the root folder of your project.
1. Copy the content of this repository into that folder.
1. Edit the library name if you want _(see details later)_.
1. Copy your project into the `library` folder.
1. Done. Your project is ready to ship.
1. You can test your library by running the `install.m` script.

## Command line way

1. Clone this repository to your system:<br />
   `git clone git@github.com:tiborsimon/MATLAB-Library-System.git my_library`<br />
   You can edit the folder name according to your needs.
1. Edit the library name if you want _(see details later)_.
1. Copy your project into the `library` folder.
1. Done. Your project is ready to ship.
1. You can test your library by running the `install.m` script.

# Folder structure

__MATLAB Library System__ has got a simple folder structure.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiborsimon/aa4f1fa04736459a6018.js"></script>

# Modifying the library properties

There are three library properties you can edit in the `my_library/librarydata.txt` file indexed by the rows of the file:

1. Library name
2. Library version
3. Message to the user after installation _(optional)_

Further lines will be ignored.

The default `librarydata.txt` file looks like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiborsimon/9a3c197ad4ade3347afa.js"></script>

These settings will produce the following output during installation.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiborsimon/bb6435be20fc9fa765d1.js"></script>

# Possible use case

You can put your every project into a __MATLAB Library System__ so you can manage them separately by installing or uninstalling them on demand. You can ship your projects to others in a nice and isolated way too. No more hassle with the MATLAB path. Your customer just runs the install script and your project is ready to use. 

_Less friction in the customer side equals happier customers :)_

# Summary

__MATLAB Library System__ provides you a clean solution for writing libraries in MATLAB. You can install and uninstall them, and you can also create an easy to ship package as well. Do you think it is useful for you? Discuss it below!
